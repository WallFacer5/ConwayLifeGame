# ConwayLifeGame
A python3.6 version implementation of Conway's game of life by myself.

## 1. calculate.py
+ Use command "python calculate.py" in your terminal to start running the fundamental Conway's Life Game; Do not run directly in PyCharm by click the green triangle.
+ Two args can be used in the command:
    1. -d or --dim: Indicates the dimension of the map of the game; Uses 100 as default value.
    2. -p or --prob: Indicates the probability of the rates of the cells which are alive initially on the map; Uses 0.2 as default value.
+ After the game has been started, there will be an animation on your screen and you can see the maps' iterations.
